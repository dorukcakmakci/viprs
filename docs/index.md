# Variational Inference of Polygenic Risk Scores (VIPRS)

This site contains documentation, tutorials, and examples for using the `viprs` package for the purposes of 
inferring polygenic risk scores (PRS) from GWAS summary statistics. The `viprs` package is a python package
that uses variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of variant effect sizes conditional 
on the GWAS summary statistics. The package is designed to be fast and accurate, and to provide a 
variety of options for the user to customize the inference process.

The details of the method and algorithms are described in detail in the following paper(s):
